        <p>I am <b>Jibola Jinadu</b>, right from a young age and being the only boy at home, 
            I have been fascinated with how things work and how I can fix sone the problems. 
            Taking apart electronics and toys, building paper ships during the rain and other stuffs which were all ways that my curiosity manifested itself, 
            I developed my interest for calculation courses for this reason, but, due to my humble family background, 
            I could not meet up with required school study materials that the sciences required so I switched to management field where 
            I consider one of greatest strength as use of <i>office application tools</i> especially Microsoft excel for solving work-related and data problems having worked for many years.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I still feel the need to do more and seek greater/new challenges to put my problem solving skills into good use, 
            which I believe Software development will really help me to achieve.

            I have really learnt a lot as Software Development Student at Stutern (Cohort 1.4). Last week we focused on <b>CSS</b> and some of the things 
            I am more knowledgeable about includes; <b>CSS</b> means <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>, how CSS gives flesh to the webpage skeleton which HTML, 
            making it more beautiful as desire and giving it a great User experience, the CSS fundamentals like the how to link CSS file and 
            HTML files together, selectors, cascade, inheritance and specificity, box model, doing more with Text (font), padding, border, margin, colour, 
            ackground effect and many more. 
        </p>

           <i>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once, with CSS, 
            you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, 
            what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</i>

            <i>The <b>padding property</b> in CSS defines the innermost portion of the box model, creating space around an element's content, 
            inside of any defined margins and/or borders, <b>padding</b> is the space between an element's border and the element's content. 
            But <b>margin</b> is the space around an element's border, the <b>margin property</b> controls the space outside an element, 
            and the <b>padding property</b> controls the space inside an element. While <b>Border</b> is the area between the box's padding and margin. 
            The CSS <b>border properties</b> allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.</i>
